* Do as much as you can on your own, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel your team is struggling.

* **NOTE:** Don't worry. We know this is a very challenging assignment. We also know that you won't know where to start. In fact, we haven't shown you EVERYTHING you need yet, but that's okay. Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error. -->
